## Application Questionnaire

1. What would you like to gain from "Summer 2021"?

In "Summer 2021", we hope that student participation in the community can be further enhanced. Further, we aim to better integrate our students' work into our community's daily maintenance and development efforts, as well as longer term goals, such that more people will be compelled to continue their participation and contribution to community affairs with the help of "Summer 2021".

2. What would your org consider to be a successful summer? (New contributors, new features completed, more code written, better being able to guide new developers into open source world, etc.)

We think a successful "Summer 2021" should:

- Allow new contributors to bring new features to our community projects, under reasonable work schedules.
- Provide necessary platforms and support to new and potential contributors, and provide guidance for future contributions to the open source ecosystem.

3. How many potential mentors have agreed to mentor this year?

Five.

4. How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?

We plan to require students and mentors to communicate in community-wide channels, sharing transparent progression and feedback. In "Summer 2020", our mentors established separate communication channels for our students, which later caused communication challenges.

5. How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?

- Provide professional guidance to students wherever possible.
- ...
- Building student awareness about the importance and methods of contributing to the open source ecosystem. This is done by providing students with opportunities to communicate and contribute directly to upstream projects with diversified workflows. This is done above all in a hope to establish not only the said awareness, but more importantly, valuable social networks that would help students with future contributions and project building.

6. Have your community ever participated om "Summer 2020"?
  - Yes.
  - How many students did your community accept for 2020?
    - Around 12.
  - How many of your community's 2020 students have been active in your community in the last 60 days?
    - 0.
