## Application Questionnaire

1. What would you like to gain from "Summer 2021"?

In "Summer 2021", we hope student participation in the community can be further ?, students' work can be further integrated into the main working stream of the community, and more people will be able to take part in community affairs with the help of "Summer 2021".

2. What would your org consider to be a successful summer? (New contributors, new features completed, more code written, better being able to guide new developers into open source world, etc.)

We think a successful "Summer 2021" should:

- allow new contributors to bring new features to the various projects in the community with reasonable task schedules;
- provide necessary platforms and supports to new and potential contributors, making two cents worth of contribution to the open source ecosystem by playing the important role of open source community.

3. How many potential mentors have agreed to mentor this year?

Five.

4. How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?

We plan to require the communication between students and mentors to join the main message stream of the community. In "Summer 2020", our mentors established separate communication channels to students, which later caused opaque about their progresses. Since all community members can view the main message stream of the community, in "Summer 2021" we will change the way we communicate in "Summer 2020".

5. How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?

We plan to:

- provide mentoring to students as professional as possible;
- assist students to
- let students to be aware of the importance of communities in the open source ecosystem by providing them the chance of experiencing various community workflows and learing how to communicate with upstreams, in the hope of generating students' _subjective initiative_ to their projects.
