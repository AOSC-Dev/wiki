## How An-an Became Sentient

An-an was a laboratory rabbit from the 6th (Psychiatric) Department of 
Peking University Health Science Center. She was one of the animal test 
subjects of a certain intelligence enhancement drug/behavior study. The 
drug was eventually concluded as useless, and the survived animals were 
adopted by the project participants and their acquaintances. Little did 
they know that those animals actually became so smart that they faked 
their tests to escape from the lab, and An-an was one of them.

An-an was adopted by a student of the University of Science and 
Technology of China. Since An-an was adorable and exceptionally 
well-behaved for an animal, people let her move freely inside the 
Computer Science Department. There she became familiar with vintage 
computers, and always help people to find the hardware they want in the 
disorganized warehouse.

An-an became a rabbit spirit a few years later, by exercising the 
instructions from some old Taoist classics she found on the internet. 
From that point on she can turn into her human form. In Luo Xiao Hei's 
terms, she is a Metal manipulator and can perform metal manipulation of 
microscopic precision. She often makes use of her abilities to fix 
broken vintage hardware.

## Connections with other characters

An-an befriended [Alice Rosetta](https://twitter.com/TysonTanX/status/1223761663612129280?s=19) in 2016 when Alice was visiting North 
China Institute of Aerospace Engineering. They were introduced by 
Alice's classmate, Ao Lei-ting, who is a actually a dragon spirit and a 
water manipulator.

Alice has a white rabbit named Cloud that she rescued from the dissect 
class of the middle school on the other side of the street of her 
primary school. Cloud is a normal rabbit, but he can communicate a lot 
using rabbit gestures with An-an.

Alice labels herself as the "child of science" and doesn't believe 
spiritual stuff at all. An-an and Lei-ting only have minor support roles 
in [Electric Hearts](https://tysontan.com/electric-hearts/). While Alice saw moments when An-an and Lei-ting 
forgetting to hide their animal ears and tails, she wrote them off as 
"just her imaginations after watching too much anime".
