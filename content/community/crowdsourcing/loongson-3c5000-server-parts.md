title = "[COMPLETE] Loongson 3C5000 Server Parts"
+++

This crowdsourcing project aims to fund components and peripherals for a Loongson 3C5000 server build.

# Rationale

In December 2024, we received a generous donation of a Loongson 3C5000 motherboard, RAM, and heatsink from [Xinmudotmoe](http://t.me/xm_moe). However, it is still missing parts before it could be hosted and go online. We would like to source funds to complete the purchase of several key components (PSU, SSD, and adaptor), as well as a rackable chassis and rails.

# Budget

From [Xinmudotmoe](http://t.me/xm_moe):

- Motherboard: 1 \* Loongson TC512A0 (Loongson 3C5000)
- RAM: 2 \* 64GiB DDR4 3200
- Heatsink: 1 \* Original 3U-spec heatsink and fan
