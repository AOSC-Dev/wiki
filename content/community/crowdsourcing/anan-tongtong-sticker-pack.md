# Rationale

We have commissioned a sticker pack from [五十根炸虾](https://www.mihuashi.com/profiles/571437) to help promote our community mascots. These stickers will be available as chat stickers and used as (parts of) our souvenirs and merchandises.

# Budget

The sticker pack was commissioned for a price of CNY 700, with CNY 100 contributed by [Kexy Biscuit](https://github.com/KexyBiscuit) who has already paid the full amount - we are crowdsourcing CNY 600 to reimburse the costs.

# Timeline

The sticker pack has already been completed and is already available on Telegram (with publication on other platforms, i.e., QQ and WeChat coming promptly).

# Participants

- Kexy Biscuit <kexybiscuit@aosc.io>, commissioner.
