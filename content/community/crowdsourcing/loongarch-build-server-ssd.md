title = "[COMPLETED] Intel 750 SSD for LoongArch Build Server"

# Rationale

Recently, Loongson Technologies (Wuhan) sponsored a LoongArch build server
(Relay 27863). However, its scratch disk is a mechanical hard drive, slowing
down builds. This crowdsourcing attempts to fund an (already purchased) Intel
750 SSD.

# Budget

The Intel 750 SSD (800GB) was purchased at the price of 699 CNY.

# Timeline

The SSD has already been shipped to Loongson Technology (Wuhan).

# Participants

- Lain Yang <fsf@live.com>, purchase and shipping coordinator.
