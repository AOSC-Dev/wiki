Title: <!-- A Brief Verb-based Proposal (Example: Upgrade BuildBot for the Loongson 3 Port)  --> 
+++

<!--

Start with a quick, one-sentence introduction.

----

Example:

This is a proposal to crowdsource a dual Loongson 3B4000 motherboard from Lemote to supplement the current 3A4000 BuildBot (Relay 23869).

-->

# Rationale

<!--

A detailed description of the reason for the purchase, focusing on the potential benefits for community activities.

----

Example:

The current BuildBot for the AOSC OS Loongson 3 port is built and tested on a 3A4000-based server (Lemote LX-1901), which, with only four cores, hardly suffices as a sole BuildBot for distribution maintenance. The significant performance discrepancy when compared to AMD64 and AArch64 BuildBots also makes it difficult to coordinate packaging among our four mainline ports.

This proposal attempts to improve the computing capacity for the Loongson 3 port with the addition of a dual 3B4000-based system, which, with a total of eight cores (across two processors) can potentially provide double the performance compared to the current BuildBot.

-->

# Budget

<!--

List potential components, services, and materials to be purchased with appropriate currency units.

----

Example:

+ Lemote LX-2510 motherboard (CNY 11,000)
  - Dual 3B4000 on board.
  - Includes compatible heatsink assemblies.
+ 2 × 16GB DIMM (CNY 750 × 2)
  - To be purchased from OEM to prevent incompatibility.

-->

# Timeline

<!--

A brief timeline for purchase, shipment, and deployment. This does not have to be final.

----

Example:

- End-of-Year 2021: Coordinator to complete purchase.
- Q1 2022:
    - A community contributor or colocation provider to host the Relay server.
    - Server to go online for distribution maintenance.

-->

# Participants

<!--

List all community participants, including coordinators, device host, etc. List merchants and/or sellers, where appropriate.

----

Example:

- Leo Shen <szc1sya@aosc.io>, purchase contact.
- Xiaoxing Ye <xiaoxing@aosc.io>, proposed server host.
