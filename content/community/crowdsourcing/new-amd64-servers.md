# Rationale

This crowdsourcing project aims to source components for *four* new AMD64 (x86-64) build servers to help digest our BuildIt! queues. Currently, there are only two (albeit very powerful) available build servers for our `amd64` jobs, we aim to deploy four more to enable more build jobs to run in parallel.

Of course, our BuildIt! infrastructure will benefit from either a job server or better use of containers and cgroups. However, in any case, more build servers means more redundancy and better overall performance.

# Budget

We would like to source the following components:

- Processors: 4 * AMD Ryzen 7 5700X - 800 * 4 = CNY 3,200
- Motherboards: Gigabyte B450M AORUS Elite - 408 * 4 = CNY 1,632
- Memory: GLOWAY 32GiB DDR4 @ 2666MHz - 285.44 * 12 = CNY 3,425.28
- Cooling: Phanteks Solar S4 - 76.5 * 4 = CNY 306
- Power Supplies: Super Flower Bronze King 450 (450W) - 259 * 4 = CNY 1,036
- Cases: SAMA Xiaozhuque M-ATX Case - CNY 96

Totals: CNY 9,695.28

# Donations

Friends of the community have donated the following to help with this crowdsourcing project:

- SSDs: 4 * Intel 750 800GB
- Cases:
    - 1 * Great Wall K15A (ATX)
    - 1 * Huntkey GX760R (ATX)
    - 1 * Unnamed (ATX)

# Timeline

Shortly after the completion of this crowdsourcing campaign, the new AMD64 build servers will go online and will be used for maintaining AOSC OS for AMD64 (x86-64).
