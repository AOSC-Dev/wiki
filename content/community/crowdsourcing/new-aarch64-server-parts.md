title = "[CROWDSOURCING] Parts for New AArch64 Build Servers"
+++

We plan to deploy two new AArch64 servers donated by friends of the community. However, these servers needs additional components before deployment, this crowdsourcing project will reimburse purchases already made for these servers.

# Rationale

Two new AArch64 servers will be deployed later this month as additional build hosts (a Phytium FT2000/64-based server and another with a 64-core Huawei Kunpeng 920 SoC), as Relays 24114 and 24514. We will install the following parts before deployment:

- Huawei Kungpeng 920
  - Scratch disks: Intel 750 @ 800GB * 1 and PCIe-to-U.2 adapter * 1
  - PCIe riser
- Phytium FT2000/64
  - Scratch disk: Intel 750 @ 800GB * 1 and PCIe-to-U.2 adapter * 1

# Budget

+ Intel 750 @ 800GB * 2 (500 CNY).
  - Used parts with 200TBW (we have one such SSD deployed with > 700TBW, with no issues observed).
  - After negotiation, these SSDs were sold at 250 CNY each.
+ PCIe riser (450 CNY).
  - New parts specific to Huawei Taishan 200 servers.
+ PCIe-to-U.2 adapters * 2 (60 CNY).
  - New parts, 30 CNY each.

# Timeline

- Early August, 2023: Coordinator to complete purchase.
- Late August, 2023: Server to go online for distribution maintenance.

# Participants

- Mingcong Bai <jeffbai@aosc.io>, purchase coordinator.
- Jack Leeï¼Œserver host.
