# Rationale

This crowdsourcing project aims to source key components for our new Loongson 3B4000 build server, which will help alleviate performance shortfall of our lone MIPS Loongson build server. In particular, we are requesting support for the case, CPU coolers, and RAM.

# Budget

- Case: SAMA Blackhole Pro, CNY 180
- RAM: UniIC SCC16GP02H1F1C-26V (16GiB) * 3, CNY 540
- CPU Coolers: MACOOL MD400H-YL * 2, CNY 95.40

Totals: CNY 815.40.

# Timeline

Shortly after the completion of this crowdsourcing campaign, the new 3B4000 server will go online and will be used for maintaining AOSC OS for MIPS Loongson.

# Participants

- Mingcong Bai <jeffbai@aosc.io>, purchase coordinator.
- Henry Chen <chenx97@aosc.io>, host.
