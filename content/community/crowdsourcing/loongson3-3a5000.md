title = "[ONGOING] Additional Loongson 3A5000 Relay"
+++

This crowdsourcing project aims to fund an additional Loongson 3A5000 device as
a community relay.

# Rationale

We plan on kickstarting our `loongarch64` mainline port this summer. While we
already have a Loongson 3A5000 setup (Relay 27001), having just one such device
makes it challenging to maintain and test the port efficiently.

Therefore, we would appreciate your help in helping us acquire an additional
3A5000 setup to help getting the port underway.

# Budget

+ Lemote A2101 motherboard (CNY 3,350).
  - Loongson 3A5000 @ 2.5GHz onboard.
  - 16GiB of compatible RAM.
  - Includes compatible heatsink assemblies.

# Timeline

- Early August, 2022: Coordinator to complete purchase.
- Late August, 2022: Server to go online for distribution maintenance.

# Participants

- Mag Mell <sakiiily@aosc.io>, purchase contact.
- Nyovelt <canarypwn@aosc.io>, courier for the board.
- Mingcong Bai <jeffbai@aosc.io>, server host.
