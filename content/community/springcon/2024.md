## Notice to Attendees

1. Those who attend via Tencent WeMeet should keep their microphones muted during the presentations
2. You may participate in the Q&A session via WeMeet, Bilibili and YouTube livestreams, and [community chat channels](https://aosc.io/zh-cn/contact)
3. If you are participating in the Q&A session via WeMeet, please use the "raise your hand" function; those who cannot participate via voice may use the chat function
4. As the SpringCon will be livestreamed on Mainland Chinese platforms, please consider if your questions or comments are appropriate
5. As the SpringCon will only last two hours, with less than an hour available for Q&A, we may only selectively respond to your questions based on time availability - we appreciate your understanding
6. This year's SpringCon is considered a trial: Apart from reporting on community projects/operations and attracting new contributors, we would also like to use this conference as an opportunity to experiment and exercise on our outreaching efforts; should there be anything that we would not deliver satisfactorily, please accept our apology
7. We will assemble a post-conference questionnaire to collect your opinions and critiques and will publish a report based on your feedback
