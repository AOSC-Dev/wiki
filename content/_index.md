Welcome to the AOSC Community Wiki!

> This is where all documentations, information, and guides will gather for users and developers alike. Please refer to the sections and links below for frequently accessed information, and use the search function to locate your specific topics.

Now this Wiki site is under heavy construction. All the old articles are here but needs to be put into different sections. Also, indexes for sections are needed in order to provide a better viewing experience. If you want to offer help, please take a look at [Wiki Maintenance Guide](@/meta/wiki_maintenance_guide.md) in the [AOSC/Wiki Meta](@/meta/_index.md) section. Then, you can contribute to the `import` branch of [AOSC-Dev/wiki](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/wiki) repository.
