Welcome! If you are reading this, you are probably interested in contributing to the AOSC OS project. This guide will guide you through all the tools and techniques you need to create, update, and maintain AOSC OS packages.

If you are new to packaging for AOSC OS, please first take a look at the [Intro to Package Maintenance: Basics](@/developer/packaging/basics.md). After that, read [Intro to Package Maintenance: Advanced Techniques](@/developer/packaging/advanced-techniques.md) for some very common techniques used in day-to-day packaging.

In order to ensure the quality of our packages (and reduce wtf moments for other developers), please follow these guidelines.
