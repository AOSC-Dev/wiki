LiveKit Review
==============

- Tofu on GRUB menu instructions (bad fonts?).
- Force 1024x768 on "command line only" mode.
- Add a multilingual menu for GRUB, or add one during boot.
- Remove the menu bar from MATE Terminal (while running as root).
- DeployKit: Broken benchmark function.
- DeployKit: Select a partition with "acceptable FS" by default (instead of
  selecting the first, which is usually the ESP).
- DeployKit: Consider adding a resume function to the download routines.
