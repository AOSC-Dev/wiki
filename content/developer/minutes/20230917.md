Topics
======

Today's meeting focuses on OSPP 2023 Project progression, Bash Config compatibility with `sudo su`, and Coffee Break review meeting planning.

- [OSPP Sync: Autobuild3 Testing Framework](#ospp-sync-autobuild3-testing-framework)
- [Bash Config](#bash-config)
- [Next Coffee Break Issue](#next-coffee-break-issue)

OSPP Sync: Autobuild3 Testing Framework
=======================================

- Framework is essentially done, testing pending.
    - Especially needs review and feedback from packagers.
    - Review design document again.
- Test using `groups/core` (except `linux+api` and `aosc-aaa`).
- Re-iterated - testing templates is necessary but not as important as a way to write custom test scripts.
- Developer review session next Saturday, UTC+8 time.
- Project goals.
    - autobuild3: Pull request with design and user documentation.
    - aosc-os-abbs: Topic with testing Autobuild3 with implementation of testing scripts for some packages.
- Leedagee will continue to maintain the framework but expects consistent help and feedback from contributors.

Bash Config
===========

Leedagee to continue research possible solutions for environment inheritence past `sudo su` - as this is a common (though discouraged) habit for many Linux users.

Bottom line - disable `env_reset` in sudo - (potentially!) dangerous but intuitive.

Next Coffee Break Issue
=======================

Meeting on Thursday, September 28, at around 8 ~ 10 P.M., UTC+8 time.
