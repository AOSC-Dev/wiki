- Saki: Confidential detail?
    - Bai: Not really.

Wallpaper Vote Planning
=======================

- Bai: How and when should we go about voting for the default?
    - Liu: I think we need to use Telegram.
        - Salted Sea: Seconded.
        - Bai: One group for display and another for voting, as with 2020?
            - Liu: That should work, maybe we could bind the two groups together.
    - Canary: Maybe we could use reactions?
        - Liu: Could be a mess, let's not.
        - Bai: Let's just stick to a good old vote.
        - Rick Liu: Maybe we could set a specific emoji?
            - Liu: Some clients still don't support reactions, also it's more work than necessary.
- Bai: We might also need a few days of lead time for resubmission and revisions. Let them have until Monday?
    - Liu: Maybe Tuesday or Wednesday? Monday would be too hasty.
    - Saki: I second Monday.
    - Bai: Let's just make it midnight before Thursday, UTC +8 time.
- Bai: Exception for the 114514 wallpaper against being voted a default wallpaper?
    - Rick Liu: But it will help us with garnering new users LOL.
    - Liu: Indeed, it's a dirty joke - but it could remain in the wallpaper pack.
    - Saki: Or we could just reject it.
        - Liu: Not appropriate, it's not against the rule.
            - Bai: Seconded.
- Bai: Should we just make 2nd place for default Retro wallpaper to save a vote?
    - Saki: No, they have very different visual targets.
        - Bai: So let's just make two votes.

Codename Nomination Planning
============================

- Bai: How should we go about collecting codenames? Google Forms?
    - Salted Fish: Let's stick with GitHub, Google Forms could be a mess with redundant submissions.
- Bai: When should we do it?
    - Liu: Just during wallpaper votes?
- Bai: Should we limit nomination for each person?
    - Liu: No.
        - Salted Fish: Seconded, as we did before.

Actionables
===========

- Bai: Notify for revisions and rejections, as well as deadlines.
