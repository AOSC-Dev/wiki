OSPP 2023
=========

- DeployKit GUI has no examination submission, project forfeited.
- Notified students for Autobuild3 Testing Framework and Localisation projects.

Website "Odyssey" Review
========================

- Figure out a standard color pallette for seasonal/locale-specific changes.
- Possible primary/secondary highlight colors to separate main navigation with secondary ones.
- List news summaries on the main page.
- Implementation.
    - Prioritise modern Web browsers.
    - Make Retro/Mobile-specific websites with reduced content.

Omakase Review
==============

- Do not list no-op commands into history (e.g., `oma upgrade` with no available update).
- "Read interrupted" error if Ctrl-C at the `oma history` menu view.
- Move `undo` and `redo` to top level?
    - No, not a frequent subcommand.
- Add a note that `undo`/`redo` will not rollback deleted/replaced configuration files.
- Uneven progress bar lengths when elipses are used.
- Limit maximal width of the UI (to 150 columns?).
    - Still needs a width limit for indicatif elements.
- Omakase segmentation faults with frequent Ctrl-C (fault in signal handler).
- Time to merge into admin-base, it’s close enough.
    - Keep apt commands around for a good amount of time.
    - Default to oma command instructions in documentation.
    - Wait for localization.
