Omakase History/Undo Design
===========================

- Limit history items to 10 per page for oma history.
- Localize all command history (Removed X, Installed Y, Upgraded system).
- Drop `oma redo`, as it is quite pointless.
- `oma history` interface.
    - Show a list of history items (dialoguer), as you do with `oma history undo`.
    - Selecting an item will "replay" the confirmation interface.
- Redraw the confirmation interface on terminal after hitting Q.

OpenSSL 3.1.1 Upgrade Testing
=============================

- Upgraded successfully on three personal machines.
- Failed from the 20220922 Desktop release, to investigate or announce as errata.
