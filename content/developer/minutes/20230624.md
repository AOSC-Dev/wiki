- Collecting "Year in Review" items.

LiveKit Review
==============

- Ease up compression ratio (aim for 4GiB .iso).
- Do not allow installing AOSC OS on btrfs or f2fs.
    - btrfs: Swapfile requires special handling.
    - f2fs: GRUB fails to save last boot entry.
- Select "use ext4" by default.
- Set 2GiB as minimum RAM required for LiveKit.
- "Partitioning" window not cleared after selecting a custom FS.
- "AOSC OS Installation" window not cleared after completion.
- Drop "to RAM" option.
